  short: "A minimalistic wallet GUI for c-lightning."
  long: |
    Spark is a minimalistic wallet GUI for c-lightning, accessible over the web or
    through mobile and desktop apps (for Android, Linux, macOS and Windows).
    It is currently oriented for technically advanced users and is not an all-in-one package,
    but rather a "remote control" interface for a c-lightning node that has to be managed separately.

    Sparks supports sending and receiving payments, viewing history, and managing channels.

    Spark is a purely off-chain wallet, with no on-chain payments.
    This allows Spark to fully realize the awesome UX enabled by lightning,
    without worrying about the complications and friction of on-chain.
    This might change someday.

    Spark has a responsive UI suitable for mobile, tablet and desktop devices,
    but is best optimized for use on mobile.

    > ⚠️ Spark is beta-quality software under active development, please use with care.
