  short: "A minimalistic wallet GUI for c-lightning."
  long: |
    Spark is a minimalistic wallet GUI for c-lightning. It supports sending and
    receiving payments, viewing history, and managing channels.

    Spark is a purely off-chain wallet, with no on-chain payments.
    This allows Spark to fully realize the awesome UX enabled by lightning,
    without worrying about the complications and friction of on-chain.
    This might change someday.
